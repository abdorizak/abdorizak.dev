## Introduction

Odoo is an open-source business management software that includes a range of business applications for various needs, such as CRM, e-commerce, accounting, inventory, project management, and more. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to set up Odoo on MacOS with Apple Silicon (M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max, M2) processors.

## Prerequisites

Before you start setting up Odoo on MacOS with Apple Silicon, ensure you have the following:

- MacOS with Apple Silicon (M\*) processor
- Homebrew installed on your MacOS [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- Python 3.8 or higher installed on your MacOS
- Node.js installed on your MacOS
- PostgreSQL installed on your MacOS (Tip: you can use DBngin to install PostgreSQL) [DBngin](https://dbngin.com/)

## Installation Steps

### üêç Step 1: Install Python

To install Python on your MacOS with Apple Silicon, use Homebrew. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
brew install python@3.8
```

### üåê Step 2: Install Node.js

To install Node.js on your MacOS with Apple Silicon, use Homebrew. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
brew install node
```

### üêç Step 3: Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

Setting up a virtual environment helps to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv odoo-env
source odoo-env/bin/activate
```

### üì¶ Step 4: Install Required Python Packages

After activating the virtual environment, install the required Python packages. Since the `psycopg2` package is not supported on Apple Silicon, replace it with `psycopg2-binary` and comment out the `psycopg2` package in the `requirements.txt` file. Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üìù Step 5: Create a Configuration File

Create a configuration file for Odoo with extension `.conf` and add the following configuration:

```bash
[options]
; Server Settings
addons_path = *path_to_your_addons*
data_dir = *path_to_your_data_dir*

; HTTP Service
http_port = 8069 ; Port for HTTP service
longpolling_port = 8072 ; Port for longpolling service

; Database Configuration
db_host = 127.0.0.1 ; Database host
db_port = 5432 ; Database port
db_user = *your_db_user*
db_password = *your_db_password*
db_name = *your_db_name*
```

### üöÄ Step 6: Start Odoo Server

If you're using PyCharm, you can create a new configuration and add the following script to start the Odoo server:

<br />
![pycharm_config](/media/blog/odoo-setup-mac/pycharm_config.png)
<br />

or you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python odoo-bin -c /path/to/your/configuration/file.conf
```
