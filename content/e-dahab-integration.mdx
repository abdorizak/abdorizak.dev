## Introduction

E-Dahab is a mobile money service provided by Somtel, a telecommunication company in Somalia. E-Dahab provides a mobile money API that allows developers to integrate mobile money services into their applications. This guide will help you to integrate E-Dahab mobile money API in your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you start integrating E-Dahab mobile money API, you need to have the following:

- Merchant account: You need to have a merchant account to receive payments through the E-Dahab mobile money API. You can create a merchant account on the E-Dahab website.
- E-Dahab account: You need to have an E-Dahab account to access the mobile money API. You can sign up for an E-Dahab account on the [E-Dahab website](https://edahab.net/sandbox/).
- API credentials: Once you have an E-Dahab account, you will receive API credentials, including an API key and a secret key. You will use these credentials to authenticate your requests to the E-Dahab mobile money API.

## Integration steps

As we embark on the integration of the E-Dahab mobile money API, it's crucial to understand that there are two primary methods for processing customer payments. The first option is **via Web Payment**, which utilizes the E-Dahab payment link. The second option is through **Pop-Up Payment**, which directly leverages the E-Dahab API. This guide will concentrate on these two integration methods.

### Step 1: Create a payment request link (Via Web Payment)

To create a payment request link using this endpoint `https://edahab.net/api/api/IssueInvoice?hash={{hash}}` where `{{hash}}` was generated from `Pre-request Script` in Postman with the following code:

```javascript
var CryptoJS = require('crypto-js');
var body = pm.request.body;
var secret = 'your-secret-key';
var hash = CryptoJS.SHA256(body + secret).toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);
pm.environment.set('hash', hash);
```

> **Note:** You need to replace `your-secret-key` with your secret key.

<br />
![Pre-request Script](/media/blog/e-dahab-integration/pre-request_script.png)
<br />
use this json body to create a payment request link:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key", // replace with your api key
  "EdahabNumber": "62xxx", // replace with your E-Dahab number
  "Amount": 1000, // Somaliland Shilling if the currency is SLSH or USD if the currency is USD
  "AgentCode": "your-agent-code", // replace with your agent code
  "ReturnUrl": "your-return-url", // replace with your return url
  "Currency": "SLSH" // USD or SLSH
}
```

<br />

<br />

After sending the request, you will receive a response with a payment request link. You can use this link to request payment from the customer.

```json
{
  "InvoiceStatus": "Unpaid",
  "TransactionId": "xxxxx", // you will get this transaction id from the response Something like this MPxxx.xxx.A9xxx
  "InvoiceId": "xxx", // you will get this invoice id from the response
  "StatusCode": 0,
  "RequestId": xxx, // you will get this request id from the response
  "StatusDescription": "Success", // you will get this status description from the response
  "ValidationErrors": null  // means their's no validation errors
}
```

## Code Example

I'll provide a different code examples for different programming languages to help you understand how to integrate E-Dahab mobile money API in your application.

### python

we're using via web payment method to create a payment request link using the following code:

```python
import asyncio
import hashlib
import json
import requests


def to_sha256(request_body_string):
    sha256_hash = hashlib.sha256()
    sha256_hash.update(request_body_string.encode("utf-8"))
    return sha256_hash.hexdigest()


async def create_invoice_async(edahab_number, amount):
    base_url = "https://edahab.net/api/api/"
    request_data = {
        "apiKey": "xxxx",
        "edahabNumber": edahab_number,
        "amount": amount,
        "agentCode": "xxxx",
        "returnUrl": "your-return-url",
    }

    request_as_string = json.dumps(request_data)
    hash_value = to_sha256(request_as_string + "xxxx")

    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    response = requests.post(
        f"{base_url}issueinvoice?hash={hash_value}",
        data=request_as_string,
        headers=headers,
    )

    if response.status_code != 200:
        return {"StatusCode": 6}

    result = response.json()
    return result or {"StatusCode": 6}


result = asyncio.run(create_invoice_async("628125834", 100))
print(result)
```

### Node.js

we're using via web payment method to create a payment request link using the following code:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
import crypto from 'crypto';

function toSha256(requestBodyString) {
  return crypto
    .createHash('sha256')
    .update(requestBodyString, 'utf8')
    .digest('hex');
}

async function createInvoiceAsync(edahabNumber, amount) {
  const baseUrl = 'https://edahab.net/api/api/';
  const request = {
    apiKey: 'xxx',
    edahabNumber: edahabNumber,
    amount: amount,
    agentCode: 'xxxx',
    returnUrl: 'your-return-url',
    currency: 'SLSH',
  };

  const requestAsString = JSON.stringify(request);
  const hash = toSha256(requestAsString + 'xxxx');

  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      `${baseUrl}issueinvoice?hash=${hash}`,
      requestAsString,
      {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      },
    );

    return response.data || { StatusCode: 6 };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    return { StatusCode: 6 };
  }
}

// Example usage
console.log('Welcome to Edahab API');
console.log('Creating invoice...');
(async () => {
  const result = await createInvoiceAsync('628125834', 100);
  console.log(result);
})();
```

> **Note:**
> You'll need to replace `apiKey`, `agentCode`, and `secret` with your actual API key, agent code, and secret key.

### Step 2: Create a payment request link (Via Pop-Up Payment)

To create a payment request we will use the same endpoint `https://edahab.net/api/api/IssueInvoice?hash={{hash}}` and the same `Pre-request Script` in Postman to generate, and we will use the same json body to create a payment request link. but it will be different the phone number of the customer, if the phone number start 65,66 only 62 will not support pop-up payment.

```json
{
  "apiKey": "your-api-key", // replace with your api key
  "edahabNumber": "65xxxx",
  "amount": 0.1,
  "agentCode": "your-agent-code", // replace with your agent code
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

> **Note:**
> the Pop-Up Payment will not work if the phone number start with 62.
> you will need to do manual payment request for the customer if the phone number start with 62.
