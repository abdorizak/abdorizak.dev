👋 Hey there,

## WaafiPay API Integration Guide

<b>WaafiPay</b> API is an application programming interface that enables the client
applications to communicate directly with WaafiPay servers in a secure environment.
The data communication happens in a predefined message format. APIs are available
in many different programming languages, allowing for easy integration into a merchant’s
existing website or application. [For more information, see the WaafiPay API Integration
Guide](https://developer.waafipay.net/reference)

### Requirements

1. To integrate WaafiPay API, you need to have a WaafiPay account.
2. You integrate your app to WaafiPay API by following the their docs or this document.
3. You need to test customer payments using Hormuud Telecom subscriber number.

### How WaafiPay API works behind the scene:

1. Customer initiates a transaction by making a request to the API.
2. WaafiPay API receives the request and validates the request.
3. WaafiPay API returns a response to the customer as popup.
4. Customer verifies the popup and enters the PIN.
5. WaafiPay API receives the PIN and validates it.
6. If the customer's balance is sufficient, and there is no any other error, WaafiPay API returns a Success response, and the payment amount is shadowed on the customer's account - Now the transaction is in PendingForPGVerification status.
7. Now, your application can commit the transaction by making a request to the API with `COMMIT`.
8. The customer account balance and the Merchant balance are updated accordingly, and the transaction status is changed to `COMPLETED`.
9. if the customer loses the connection, you can cancel the transaction by making a request to the API with `CANCEL`.

## How to use the WaafiPay API

**Endpoint**: `https://api.waafipay.com/asm`.

To integrate WaafiPay API into your application, you need to follow the steps below:

### PreAuthorize

Pre-authorization also known as an authorization hold is a practice by which the WaafiPay API allows you to place a hold on an amount approved as part of a transaction. The WaafiPay essentially holds that part of the customer's balance in reserve for a while until you clear the transaction.

Here is an example of pre-authoriza transaction **Request** in JSON format:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "requestId": "195306036", // you can pass generated requestId or any unique id you want.
  "timestamp": "timestamp", // pass the current timestamp
  "channelName": "WEB",
  "serviceName": "API_PREAUTHORIZE", // API_PREAUTHORIZE
  "serviceParams": {
    "merchantUid": "xxxxxxx",
    "apiUserId": "xxxxxxx",
    "apiKey": "xxxxxxx",
    "paymentMethod": "MWALLET_ACCOUNT",
    "payerInfo": {
      "accountNo": "25261xxxxxxx" // payer phone number
    },
    "transactionInfo": {
      "referenceId": "113630898323",
      "invoiceId": 70152,
      "amount": "1.00",
      "currency": "USD",
      "description": "test"
    }
  }
}
```

### PreAuthorizeResponse

Here is an example of pre-authoriza transaction success **Response** in JSON format:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "2022-07-31 10:52:56.19", // you will receive timestamp you passed in the request
  "requestId": "132423495306036", // you will receive requestId you passed in the request
  "sessionId": null,
  "responseCode": "2001",
  "errorCode": "0",
  "responseMsg": "RCS_SUCCESS",
  "params": {
    "issuerApprovalCode": "",
    "accountNo": "25261xxxxxxx",
    "accountType": "mwallet_account",
    "accountholder": "",
    "state": "APPROVED", // or "forApproval"
    "merchantCharges": "0.01",
    "customerCharges": "0.0",
    "referenceId": "12212",
    "transactionId": "25420603",
    "accountExpDate": "",
    "issuerTransactionId": "13552358225",
    "txAmount": "1.0"
  }
}
```

If the customer's account balance is not sufficient, the API will return an error response like the following:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "2022-07-31 16:49:24.711", // get the timestamp you passed in the request
  "requestId": "56272FF2-2AD5-4260-9EC8-D3A916A834EE", // generated requestId you passed in the request
  "responseCode": "5206",
  "errorCode": "E10205",
  "responseMsg": "RCS_TRAN_FAILED_AT_ISSUER_SYSTEM (Your account balance is not sufficient, mobile No: {RECEIVER_MOBILE_NO}, TransactionId: 25425740",
  "params": {
    // Note: the params will be empty if the transaction is not successful.
    "issuerApprovalCode": "",
    "accountNo": "",
    "accountType": "",
    "accountholder": "",
    "state": "",
    "merchantCharges": "",
    "customerCharges": "",
    "referenceId": "",
    "transactionId": "",
    "accountExpDate": "",
    "issuerTransactionId": "",
    "txAmount": ""
  }
}
```

Here is an example of making payment using Swift language:

```swift
func makePayment(_ number: String, _ amount: Double) async throws {
  do {
      self.response = try await call.makePayment(number: number, amount: amount)
      guard let response = response else {
           return
       }
      print("Response: \(String(describing: response))")
      if response.responseCode == "2001" {
          if NetworkMonitor.shared.isConnected {
              let res = try await call.makeCommit(requestId: response.requestId ?? "1",
                                                  timestamp: response.timestamp ?? "1",
                                                  services: "API_PREAUTHORIZE_COMMIT",
                                                  transactionId: response.params?.transactionId ?? "1",
                                                  referenceId: response.params?.transactionId ?? "1",
                                                  description: "Commited")
              print("$##the Response\(res)")
          } else {
              let res = try await call.makeCommit(requestId: response.requestId ?? "1",
                                                  timestamp: response.timestamp ?? "1",
                                                  services: "API_PREAUTHORIZE_CANCEL",
                                                  transactionId: response.params?.transactionId ?? "1",
                                                  referenceId: response.params?.transactionId ?? "1",
                                                  description: "Cancel Transaction")
              print("$$the response\(res)")
          }
      } else {
          print("tres: \(response.responseMsg?.substring(from: 34, to: 71) ?? "empty")")
      }
      } catch {
        throw MerchantErrors.unableTopComplete
      }
}
```

### PreAuthorize Commit

If you sent your payment PreAuthorize and then commit it the payment is fully PreAuthorized and following things will heppen:

1. Commits the original transaction done by PreAuthorize service.
2. deducts funds from customer account including charges

Here's PreAuthorize commit json format⬇️:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "requestId": "2749007837",
  "timestamp": "2022-07-31 Africa",
  "channelName": "WEB",
  "serviceName": "API_PREAUTHORIZE_COMMIT",
  "serviceParams": {
    "merchantUid": "xxxxxxx", //_______
    "apiUserId": "xxxxxxxx", //      |____ // these are credentials you must have either will not work.
    "apiKey": "xxxxxxxx", //______|
    "transactionId": "1238336",
    "description": "", // you will pass if transaction is successful as commit else you will pass the Cancel Transaction.
    "referenceId": "11111"
  }
}
```

### A PreAuthorize Cancel transaction

If you sent your payment PreAuthorize and then commit it and you want to cancel the payment this request would be cancel it and the following things happen:

1. Cancels the original transaction done by PreAuthorize service
2. returns the funds to customer account

This scenario happens when:

- the customer loses connection to the network
  Here's PreAuthorize cancel json format⬇️:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "requestId": "2749007837",
  "timestamp": "2022-07-31 Africa",
  "channelName": "WEB",
  "serviceName": "API_PREAUTHORIZE_CANCEL",
  "serviceParams": {
    "merchantUid": "xxxxxxx", //_______
    "apiUserId": "xxxxxxxx", //      |____ // these are credentials you must have either will not work.
    "apiKey": "xxxxxxxx", //______|
    "transactionId": "1238336",
    "description": "", // you will pass if transaction is successful as commit else you will pass the Cancel Transaction.
    "referenceId": "11111"
  }
}
```

Here's is an example of commit function⬇️:

```swift
func makeCommit(requestId: String, timestamp: String, transactionId: String, referenceId: String, description: String) async throws -> MerchantResponse {
    guard let url = URL(string: Constants.endPoint) else {
        throw MerchantErrors.invalidURL
    }

    let body = PreAuthorizeCommit(requestId: requestId, timestamp: timestamp, serviceParams: ServiceParamsCommit(merchantUid: "xxxxxxx", apiUserId: "xxxxxxx", apiKey: "API-xxxxxxxx", transactionId: transactionId, description: description, referenceId: referenceId))

    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"
    request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
    let encoder = try? JSONEncoder().encode(body)
    request.httpBody = encoder

    let (data, response) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)

    guard let response = response as? HTTPURLResponse, response.statusCode == 200 else {
        throw MerchantErrors.inValidResponse
    }

    do {
        return try JSONDecoder().decode(MerchantResponse.self, from: data)
    } catch {
        throw MerchantErrors.inValidData
    }
}
```
